# Hack Nights Impromp2 Game

> This game was made as part of an impromptu game jam for Queen's Hack Nights.
> It was made over the course of about 4 hours, from 6:30-10:30 PM.

## Running
At some point, I may have the Unity web player build, but for now, download the project and open it with Unity, then hit build. The main scene is `Untitled.unity`.

## Gameplay
Use your rocket launcher (left click) to fire rockets. When they hit something, they will explode!

The goal of the game is to activate all of the targets (floating semitransparent grey circles) with the boxes. The only way to do this is by firing your rockets at the boxes!

When a target is active, it will turn green. When your score (upper left hand corner) reads 10/10, you win!
